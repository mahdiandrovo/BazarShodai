While shopping for groceries, itâ€™s very common for us to forget many important things and ironically we remember them after returning from the store. Listing with pen and paper can come to the rescue but in a smart world, handmade list might not be a clever thing to do. A smart way to list up the grocery items will be a perfect idea in this scenario and this app presents an easy and efficient approach for that.

##### Application Overview:
Functions of this app is quite easy. All the grocery items can be added one by one using the add button. This will need title, amount and description as input. Once done, the item is added to the list. User can close the app then and the details will be stored in the database. The next time the app is opened the listed items will be displayed based on their quantity. Sliding to the left deletes an item from the list which means a user can easily delete an item from the list. So a user can list up the needed groceries at home, buy items one by and delete the corresponding item from the list so that no item is left forgotten and all the necessary groceries are bought. As easy as that!
